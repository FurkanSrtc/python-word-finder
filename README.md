#Wordfinder

Based on https://towardsdatascience.com/very-simple-python-script-for-extracting-most-common-words-from-a-story-1e3570d0b9d0.

To start, run `start.sh` to update pip3 and install dependencies, then `python3 wordfinder.py` to run the wordfinder. It operates on the contents of `text.txt`.
